# hello-world
first repository

My name is Chawon and I am trying to become a great Python programmer. I've been reading a lot but feel like I only know the basics. I need to figure out how to take my learning to the next level. It's been difficult finding real world examples to learn from. I hope github helps me in my own python development.
